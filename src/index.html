          <p>Hello there!  Welcome to my doctor finder app, which I made for an Epicodus independent code review.  To use this webpage (which accesses the better doctor API) you will need an API key from <a href="https://developer.betterdoctor.com/">https://developer.betterdoctor.com/</a>, further instructions on how to set up this project can be found in the README.md file. <br>
            Once you have all that ready to go you may enter a symptom in the input field to the left, and you will be given a list of Doctors.  For example entering 'Cancer' into the input field will show a list of Oncologists and other specialtists.  The API call can be slow at times, so please be patient as it loads.<br>
            Enjoy!</p>
